# DigiVoter

Extensive technological advancements have been witnessed in the last two
decades; however, in the last two years alone, we have seen schools, institutions
and organizations move to a completely online environment. Hence, the idea of
a Voting System that runs on the browser does not seem too far-fetched.
Traditionally, voting is implemented using polling booths/EVMs in case of
governmental bodies, or using Ballot Box System in institutions, for example,
schools and offices. With DigiVoter, our aim is to develop a highly accessible,
cost-effective, secure and reliable web-app based voting system that enables a
group of people or organizations to conduct in-house elections online thereby
eliminating the need to gather in-person or make use of insecure means, a
platform that ensures efficient Management and Protection of Data.
Additionally, measures will be taken to prevent Voter Fraud, and efforts, to
obtain Verifiable Proof that the results werenâ€™t unfairly manipulated. It features
an Admin Panel to tailor the voting environment as per client requirement. Bonus
features of the project will be reports including Visualized Statistical Data and
Notification.
